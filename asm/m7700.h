	m7700 instructions

	m and x flags select between word, byte operations for each instruction
	This allows for some instructions to be 8 bit, and some to be 16 bit. 

	Each instruction also has an addressing mode that can fall into one of 28 different categories. 

	There are a grand total of 103 instructions for the base m7700, each has a few permutations for each of the
	addressing/bit length mode above.
